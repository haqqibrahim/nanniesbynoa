							<p>Welcoming a new addition to the family is a joyous occasion, but it also comes with the challenge of deciding the best care for your newborn. Many parents grapple with the decision of whether to hire a Nanny or a Newborn Care Specialist, referred to as NCS. Both options offer unique benefits, and understanding the difference between the two can help you make an informed choice tailored to your family’s needs.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Roles:</h2>
<h3>Nannies</h3>
<p>Nannies are experienced childcare providers responsible for the overall well-being and development of your child. They offer varying levels of expertise, ranging from general childcare to specialized skills in infant care to those with special needs. Nannies typically work on a long-term basis, providing care for children of all ages from infancy and up.</p>
<h3>NCS</h3>
<p>Newborn Care Specialists specialize in the care of infants, particularly during the first few weeks or months of life. They are trained to address the unique needs and challenges that come with caring for newborns, offering expertise in areas such as feeding, sleep training, and soothing techniques. Their support is often more short-term and intensive during the crucial early weeks.</p>
<h2>Situations Where Each Shines:</h2>
<h3>Nannies:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nannies are ideal for families with children of different ages. They can adapt to the changing needs of your growing family.</li>
<li>If you’re looking for a caregiver who will be a consistent presence in your child’s life for an extended period, a nanny might be the better choice.</li>
<li>Nannies can provide comprehensive care, assisting with educational activities, extracurriculars, and household tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Newborn Care Specialists:</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re specifically seeking support during the early weeks of your newborn’s life, a NCS’s focused expertise can be invaluable.</li>
<li>NCS’s are often well-versed in sleep training techniques, helping establish healthy sleep patterns for both baby and parents.</li>
<li>For families requiring additional aid during the postpartum period, an NCS can offer both emotional and physical support, ensuring a smoother transition into parenthood.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making the Decision:</h2>
<p>Consider the following factors to guide your decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you’re primarily seeking support during the newborn phase, an NCS may be more suitable. However, if you have older children or require long-term care, a nanny would be a better fit.</li>
<li>NCS’s often have higher hourly rates due to their specialized skills. Consider your budget and duration of care needed when making your decision.</li>
<li>Assess your family’s unique dynamics, factoring the ages of your other children, the nuances of your work commitments, and the overarching needs for your childcare requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Choosing between a nanny and an NCS is a significant decision that depends on your family’s specific needs. By understanding the roles and strengths of each option, you can make an informed choice that provides the best possible care for your child while aligning with your family’s lifestyle and priorities.</p>
<p>Whichever you decide, Nannies by Noa is here to support and guide you through the process of find the perfect caregiver for your family.</p>						</div>

							<p>“What? I have to know how to interview an NCS?”</p><p>Even the most seasoned human resources experts tends to get a little flustered when it comes to interviewing someone for a job that they as the employer are not even fully sure they understand but having a few key questions to ask along with knowing that the agency has already vetted candidates’ main qualifications can help this process go more smoothly. The biggest key is evaluating if this person seems like a good personality fit, being comfortable with how they would handle a stressful situation and ensuring they support your beliefs around parenting this small new human coming into your life.</p><p>We are going to share the top questions and discussion points we suggest that families should ask a potential NCS candidate as they are making a final decision. Of course, knowing as much as you can about the role and what your family needs will make this process easier, but here are a few to help you out.</p><ul><li><em>Tell us how you manage supporting a parent who wants to nurse their baby and someone who plans to utilize bottles and/or formula.</em></li><li><em>Have you ever had a conflict with a family you have worked with, and how did you handle it?</em></li><li><em>What are your views on baby sleep and how will you handle it if ours differ or even change after the baby arrives?</em></li><li><em>What do you wish all new parents knew that very few actually do?</em></li><li><em>What do you think I should ask in this interview?</em></li></ul><p>Each of these questions is open-ended and requires not only some thought, but they are more than yes/no questions. It is also important for you as a parent to think about what answers you are hoping to get from these questions and what answers could be a potential red flag that this candidate, even if they are well qualified, might not be the right fit for your family. The more thought you put into this process prior to hiring, the greater the chance that all will go well after.</p><p>As an agency, we can offer a list of questions that can help you find the best fit quickly. High quality NCS candidates are in high demand and are contracted quickly, so the more efficient your process is, the greater your chance of hiring the care provider you want. Let us help!</p>						</div>

Questions around pay and taxes are ones we commonly hear as an agency, and while we of course always recommend you discuss this with a domestic employment and payroll provider and your personal tax advisor, we can give you the general answers to these questions. While we wish this was just a straightforward answer, the reality is the answer is: it depends.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Most of the time, the reality is the NCS actually should be an employee of the household, just like a nanny is, but there are rare occasions, under very specific circumstances, where they can operate as a business and be paid as an employee of their own company. And there are sometimes circumstances that make it more appropriate for them to be an employee of the referring agency as well. According to domestic tax experts, based on governmental guidelines, the single biggest determinant of who is the employer is who is in control of the work being done. If you as the employer are setting the hours and the rate of pay and negotiating the terms of the contract, then the NCS should be your employee. If the NCS is setting all of these terms, (along with a few other stipulations), then their personal business is the employer and if the agency is setting these terms, then they are the employer.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Each of these particular circumstances has many variables that have pluses and minuses for the agency, for the NCS, and being sure that you are in compliance with local and Federal employment guidelines is very important to avoid possible tax and legal issues later.</p><p> </p><p class="MsoNormal">At the end of the day, it is always wise to look at all the scenarios, discuss the specifics with your personal tax and legal advisors, look at what both you and the NCS candidates need and what we as the agency have shared with you. For many of you, having employees is not something you had planned on, but if you plan to have a nanny at any point in the future, getting set up as employer now saves you that work later. Our agency can provide you with both information and referrals to providers of domestic employment tax advice and services. Contact us today for more information.</p>						</div>

							<p>Establishing a strong and trusting relationship with the families you work for as a nanny or newborn care specialist (NCS) is essential for a successful and fulfilling experience. This bond not only benefits the children in your care but also contributes to a positive and harmonious work environment. In this blog, we will explore valuable tips to help nannies and NCS professionals build and nurture strong relationships with the families they serve.</p><h2>1. Open and Clear Communication</h2><p>Effective communication is the cornerstone of any successful relationship. Maintain an open line of communication with the parents right from the beginning. Regularly discuss expectations, routines, and any concerns. Actively listen to parents’ preferences and provide updates on the children’s progress and daily activities. Encourage parents to express their thoughts and concerns, creating an environment of trust and understanding.</p><h2>2. Respect Boundaries</h2><p>Respecting the family’s privacy and boundaries is crucial. Always ask for permission before sharing photos or information about the children on social media or with others. Understand the family’s guidelines regarding screen time, dietary preferences, and parenting philosophies, and make sure to adhere to them consistently.</p><h2>3. Share Knowledge and Expertise</h2><p>If you are a newborn care specialist or possess specialized childcare skills, share your knowledge with the parents in a respectful and non-intrusive manner. Offer tips on sleep training, feeding, and developmental milestones, but always be mindful of their preferences and decisions as parents.</p><h2>4. Handle Challenges with Grace</h2><p>Challenges are bound to arise, but how you handle them can make all the difference. If there’s a disagreement or a difficult situation, approach it calmly and professionally.  Express your concerns while actively listening to the parents’ perspective. A respectful discussion will lead to a resolution that benefits everyone.</p><h2>5. Continual Self-Improvement</h2><p>Childcare practices and parenting approaches evolve over time. Stay updated on the latest childcare trends and consider attending workshops or courses to enhance your skills. Demonstrating your commitment to ongoing learning can reassure parents that you are dedicated to providing the best care for their children.</p><p>Building a strong and enduring relationship with the families you serve requires dedication, effective communication, and a genuine passion for childcare. By following these tips, you can create a nurturing and positive environment that benefits both the children and their parents, ensuring a rewarding and fulfilling experience for everyone involved. Remember, Nannies by Noa is here to support in your journey to find the perfect family. Our resources and guidance can provide additional insights and assistance as you work towards establishing meaningful connections and becoming an integral part of the families you care for.</p>						</div>

							<p>Many clients wait until a few weeks before their baby is born to begin their search for an NCS and then are surprised with how limited their options are. Most have no idea of how “hot” the market is for qualified candidates and how far in advance they actually should start their search. The reality is that a quality NCS can oftentimes be booked months (9 or more!) in advance. How is that even possible you might ask. Well here is how: often if a family has had the benefit of an NCS prior, they know the value of the help the NCS provides and their second call, right after “honey, I am pregnant” is to check their prior NCS’s availability. And believe it or not, many clients who are undergoing fertility treatments will actually ask an NCS to pencil them in prior to their fertility procedures! Many even schedule those procedures around the availability of a specific NCS they want for their family.</p><p>Sometimes families expecting their first child will reach out about it, and if they are hearing the name of a specific NCS more than once in their local parenting groups, will work to secure that NCS early on in the process. Those that plan ahead have the most options for sure.</p><p>Does that mean if you are later to the game, you cannot find a quality NCS? Absolutely not! In fact, our agency has a number of NCS candidates who prefer to only do short-term or fill-in placement work and therefore do not book out as far in advance. And of course, sometimes a booked client will have a change in circumstances and an NCS that was booked becomes available. And finally, we as an agency are always actively seeking out the highest quality candidates to add to our roster, so we may have someone amazing who just joined our team and is ready to serve your family.</p><p>In an ideal world, searching for and securing your NCS is done early in a pregnancy, but even at the last minute, our agency works hard to help you find qualified and experienced candidates to help support your growing family. Contact us today for more information on our process and to get your NCS search started.</p>						</div>

							<p>Within the realm of caregiving, nannies play a vital role in providing love, support, and guidance to children and their families. However, it is crucial to recognize the emotional toll this work can take on caregivers, leading to a phenomenon known as compassion fatigue. Today, we will delve into the concept of compassion fatigue, understand its underlying causes, identify its symptoms, and explore effective strategies for addressing and preventing its impact. By shedding light on this often-overlooked aspect of caregiving, we hope to promote awareness and support for the well-being of childcare providers in their demanding roles.</p><p>Compassion fatigue is a condition characterized by emotional exhaustion and a decreased ability to empathize and connect with others. Nannies are particularly susceptible to compassion fatigue due to the nature of their work, which involves continuously tending to the needs and emotions of children while often neglecting self-care.</p><h2>Causes of Compassion Fatigue in Caregivers:</h2><p>1. Emotional Intensity: Nannies often develop deep emotional bonds with the children they care for, investing their love and energy into nurturing them. This emotional intensity can drain their emotional reserves over time.</p><p>2. Lack of Boundaries: It can be challenging to establish boundaries between personal and professional life, leading to the blurring of roles and difficulties in disconnecting from work-related emotions.</p><p>3. Multiple Stressors: Caregivers often juggle various responsibilities, such as managing household chores, assisting with homework, and organizing activities. Balancing these demands can lead to chronic stress and emotional exhaustion.</p><p>4. Vicarious Trauma: Witnessing or hearing about traumatic events experienced by the children or their families can have a profound impact on emotional well-being, causing cumulative stress and compassion fatigue.</p><h2>Recognizing the Symptoms:</h2><p>Someone experiencing compassion fatigue may exhibit the following signs:</p><p>1. Chronic exhaustion and physical fatigue</p><p>2. Emotional numbness or detachment</p><p>3. Reduced empathy and patience</p><p>4. Irritability, mood swings, or increased sensitivity</p><p>5. Feelings of helplessness or hopelessness</p><p>6. Sleep disturbances and changes in appetite</p><p>7. Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</p><p>8. Increased susceptibility to illness or frequent headaches</p><h2>Addressing and Preventing Compassion Fatigue:</h2><p>1. Boundaries and Time Off: Establish clear boundaries between work and personal life, allowing for dedicated time off to recharge, pursue hobbies, or simply relax.</p><p>2. Support Networks: Connect with other nannies or childcare professionals to share experiences, offer support, and gain insights into coping strategies.</p><p>3. Seek Professional Help: If compassion fatigue symptoms persist, seeking guidance from a mental health professional can be beneficial in understanding and addressing underlying causes.</p><p>4. Training and Education: Nannies should participate in workshops or training programs that focus on stress management, emotional resilience, and self-care techniques.</p><p>5. Communicate with Employers </p><p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/signs-compassion-fatigue">By recognizing the underlying causes and symptoms of compassion fatigue, we can take proactive measures to address and prevent its detrimental effects. </a>Let us strive to raise awareness and support for the emotional needs of nannies, acknowledging their invaluable role in shaping the lives of children and their families.</p>						</div>

							<p>You are an experienced parent; you already have 1 or more children, so what could an NCS possibly offer you that you don’t already know?</p>
<p>This is a great question actually, and one we hear more often than you might think, so we wanted to Share with you the top three things an NCS can offer an experienced family like yours.</p>
<h2>1. Time with your current child or children</h2>
<p>We know that sounds odd, but think back to your first child’s arrival for a minute. Their arrival dominated everything in your life. You were lucky to take a shower or grab a quick snack. And while you are much more experienced now, another baby is going to recreate much of that same environment again. Except that now you have a 3-year-old who does not understand why their parents don’t have as much time for them, is too tired to play tag or cannot toss them in the air like before. And so they are hurt and confused. They might even be feeling jealousy or resentment towards this new arrival and not have the words to articulate their emotions. While your new baby certainly needs you and will definitely consume much of your time, having an expert to care for them while you spend some much-needed time with your first child can really allow you to be present in that moment. And, when it is time to feed or care for your new baby, they can often also distract your current child with an invitation to help or to read a short story.</p>
<h2>2. Opportunities to learn</h2>
<p>Even the most experienced parent may not be up on the latest evidence-based information or products. Or maybe, without professional help the first time around, you might even have incorrect information from well-meaning friends or family members. An NCS who is up on current information, familiar with current products and well-educated around best practices can share that information with you so that you, as the parent, can make the best decisions for your family. Whether it is around sleep, feeding, safety or other baby related topics, a quality NCS stays in the know and can help you learn also.</p>
<h2>3. Sleep</h2>
<p>Every new parent, whether they have 1 child or 5, wants and needs sleep. And having a qualified caregiver in your home to handle night wakings, diaper changes and to bring the baby to you for feeding can make that possible. Science clearly shows us that sleep is key to recovery from any medical procedure or event that is taxing on the body. Birth, in all its forms, falls into one or more of these categories. And knowing your baby is being well cared for, having their needs met and brought to you for feedings can allow you to rest and recover much faster and better than you would if you did not have the help.</p>
<p>Our agency is committed to helping your new or expanding family be the best they can be; let us help you find support and care for you and your new baby and make this wonderful life transition go smoothly.</p>						</div>

							<h2>1. Training</h2>
<p>These days, most quality NCS are trained through an education company, but not all are, and that does not mean they are not qualified. But overall, keeping up with information and current evidence-based best practices can be challenging, so an NCS with quality training is a wise consideration. Our job as an agency is to not only know which education companies are offering quality training, but also how to evaluate each individual candidate to ensure they have a good knowledge base and the skills to serve your family well. We ask a lot of questions in our vetting process to ensure they are ready to do just that.</p>
<h2>2. References</h2>
<p>Even though we as an agency check the references of all of our candidates, we also strongly encourage you to also speak to a few of them. This will help you get a good sense of who this candidate is and if their personality and skills are a good mesh for your family. As an agency, we work hard in this area also, selecting those candidates that we feel are the best fit for your family.</p>
<h2>3. Know your needs</h2>
<p>Often new families come to us without a true understanding of their needs because they often don’t know what an NCS can really do for them. But we do! So, use the intake time with our agency as an opportunity to help us get to know you and what you want. Filling out our questions in-depth really helps us narrow down the selection of candidates so you often only have to spend time interviewing 1-2 people before you have a great fit!</p>
<h2>4. And finally, trust your instincts</h2>
<p>A candidate may look fantastic on paper, and likely is, in fact, fantastic. But that doesn&#8217;t always make them fantastic for you. And oftentimes your instincts will pick up on that, even when you consciously do not. (This also works the other way around; you often recognize the perfect candidate immediately.) So we strongly encourage you to pay close attention to those feelings, and see if you can determine—are these just nerves, or do I have some real underlying concerns. You’ve made the decision to hire an NCS for your family, and knowing you are going to have professional support when your new baby arrives is great and such a relief, but then the next question arises? What should I look for? How do I select the right candidate? And that is where we come into the equation for you as an agency. Let’s take a look at a few of the things you should look for and how we can help you sort this all out.</p>
<p>Overall, you will find that when you work with an agency, much of the work is done for you and your job really is just to ask yourself “who fits me best?” and then trusting that. There is an exciting time coming for your family and we are proud to be a part of It.</p>						</div>

Examples of sensory activities include playing with different textures like sand, water, slime, or listening to music, exploring different scents, painting with different colors and materials, and tasting different foods.</p><h2><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Why are sensory activities good for development?</span></h2><p><a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-sensory-play-ideas/">These activities are not only enjoyable, but they also help with children’s cognitive and physical development. </a>These stimulating activities engage multiple senses and aid in development of sensory processing, which is important for learning, communication, and overall development. Sensory activities can also improve attention, concentration, and fine motor skills. One study showed that encouraging sensory play with fruits and vegetables may encourage preschool children to taste new foods!</p><h2><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Here are some Nanny-tested sensory adventures to try out:</span></h2><h3>Sensory bins</h3><p>Fill a plastic bin with materials such as rice, beans, or sand and let your kiddos explore with their hands and senses.</p><h3><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Obstacle courses</span></h3><p>Create a fun obstacle course in the backyard or living room using pillows, cones, and other household items.</p><h3><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Sensory bottles</span></h3><p>Fill a bottle with water and items such as glitter, beads, or small toys. Seal it up and let them shake and watch the items move around.</p><h3><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Messy play</span></h3><p>Let them get messy with finger painting, shaving cream play, or even making slime.</p><h3><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Sensory Walks</span></h3><p>Take a walk and encourage them to use their senses to explore their surroundings. Ask them to describe what they see, hear, smell, and feel.</p><h3><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Scent Station</span></h3><p>Set up a station where they can smell different herbs, spices, or essential oils and guess what they are.</p><h3><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Sensory “I Spy”</span></h3><p>Play a game of &#8220;I Spy&#8221; where children have to find items of different textures around the house or outside.</p><p><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Remember to always supervise during sensory activities and choose materials that are safe for the child’s age group. As a Nanny, it&#8217;s important to provide early learning activities that engage the senses and promote learning. Not only will the kid’s have a blast, but their parents will be thrilled as well!</span></p>						</div>

							<p>Dogs are some of the most lovable creatures on earth, and meeting one can be an incredible experience for both children and adults. As the weather turns pleasant and people spend more time outdoors with their beloved pets, it’s important to learn how to approach dogs safely and respectfully for a positive and enjoyable experience. Here are some tips to help you introduce your little ones to our furry friends and develop a lifelong love and appreciation for them.</p><h2><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">1. Ask for permission and approach calmly.</span></h2><p><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">First and foremost, always ask the owner for permission before approaching a new dog. Some dogs may not be comfortable with strangers, and the owner will be able to tell you whether it’s safe to approach or not. If the owner gives you the green light, approach the dog slowly and calmly. Avoid running or making sudden movements that could startle the dog. As you approach the pet, offer the back of your hand for them to sniff. This will allow the pet to get to know your scent and help them feel more comfortable around you. Once the dog has had a chance to sniff and get to know you, you can then pet the dog on either the chest or shoulder – not the top of the head.</span></p><h2><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">2. Pet gently and avoid sensitive areas.</span></h2><p><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Teach children how to pet dogs gently, using slow and steady strokes. Children should avoid pulling on the dog’s ears or tail, as this can be uncomfortable or even painful for the dog. Encourage them to show kindness and respect towards dogs by petting them in a gentle and considerate manner.</span></p><h2><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">3. Respect a dog’s personal space.</span></h2><p><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Teaching children to respect a dog’s personal space, especially when the dog is eating or sleeping, is incredibly important. They can learn to recognize when a dog is showing signs of discomfort or fear, such as growling or baring its teeth, and know to keep their distance.</span></p><h2><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">4. Supervise interactions between children and dogs.</span></h2><p><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Adults should always supervise interactions between children and dogs, especially when the children are very young. Even the most well-trained dog can be unpredictable, and children may not know how to interpret a dog’s signals. This will help prevent accidents or mishaps that could result from a child’s natural curiosity.</span></p><p><span style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );">Fostering a positive relationship between children and dogs begins with understanding and implementing safe and respectful interactions. By following these tips, we can ensure that both children and dogs have enjoyable experiences together. These guidelines not only promote the well-being of our furry friends but also cultivate a sense of empathy, responsibility, and lifelong love for animals in children.</span></p>						</div>

<h1>Start out in Savasana.</h1>
<h1 style="color: #211e15;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Savasana-300x300.png" alt="A sketch of a woman in savasana pose" width="300" height="300"></h1>
<p>Start out by lying on your back. Have your little one set&nbsp;their hands on their tummy and encourage them to feel their hands go up and&nbsp;down with each breath. Stay here for a few breaths.</p>
<h1>Rock up!</h1>
<div>&nbsp;<img decoding="async" style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );" src="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rock-up-300x300.png" alt="A sketch of a woman lying on her back, grabbing her feet so that she can rock up to a seated position" width="300" height="300"></div>
<p>Next, while on your back grab onto feet or ankles, and try&nbsp;and rock back and forth a few times until finally landing in a seated position on the floor.</p>
<h1>Child’s Pose</h1>
<div>&nbsp;<img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3925" src="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Childs-Pose-1-300x300.png" alt="A sketch of a woman in child's pose" width="300" height="300" style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );" srcset="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Childs-Pose-1-300x300.png 300w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Childs-Pose-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Childs-Pose-1-150x150.png 150w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Childs-Pose-1-768x768.png 768w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Childs-Pose-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div>
<p>From here, get on all fours. Show your toddler how to place&nbsp;their hands under their shoulders and their knees under their hips. Root your&nbsp;hands and feet down into the ground, encouraging them to feel the floor. Push your body back while extending your arms so your forearms, forehead, shins, and tops of your feet rest on the floor. Feel free to use a small pillow or towel to support your head. Encourage your little one to fill their belly while they&nbsp;breathe and notice how it feels nice.</p>
<h1>Cat &amp; Cow</h1>
<div><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3922" src="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cow-300x300.png" alt="A sketch of a woman in cow pose" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cow-300x300.png 300w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cow-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cow-150x150.png 150w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cow-768x768.png 768w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cow.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3920" style="color: var( --e-global-color-text );" src="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cat-300x300.png" alt="A sketch of a woman in Cat pose" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cat-300x300.png 300w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cat-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cat-150x150.png 150w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cat-768x768.png 768w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cat.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div>
<p>Press yourselves up back on all fours, hands, shins and tops&nbsp;of feet rooted in the ground. For cow position, take a deep breath in, raise your gaze toward the sky and send your belly down to the ground for a gentle&nbsp;back bend. Moving into cat position, exhale as you drop your head and send your&nbsp;spine up towards the sky. Cycle through this as many times as feels right in&nbsp;your bodies. Model for your kiddo how to keep breathing through it—inhale as&nbsp;you lift your head, exhale as you drop your head.</p>
<h1>Downward Facing Dog</h1>
<div><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3923" src="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downward-Facing-Dog-300x300.png" alt="A sketch of a woman in downward facing dog pose" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downward-Facing-Dog-300x300.png 300w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downward-Facing-Dog-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downward-Facing-Dog-150x150.png 150w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downward-Facing-Dog-768x768.png 768w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Downward-Facing-Dog.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div>
<p>When you’re all ready to move on, while still on all fours,&nbsp;tuck your toes, press your hands into the ground—reminding your toddler how&nbsp;strong their arms are! Lift your knees off the ground, and straighten your legs&nbsp;as you extend and straighten your arms. Send your hips up toward the sky. This&nbsp;is downward facing dog. Count together as you take five breaths in this&nbsp;position. Feel free to use props as needed, maybe a stack of books under your&nbsp;arms or maybe pedal your legs as you settle into the pose. Wiggling is natural&nbsp;and welcomed!</p>
<h1>Bound Angle Pose</h1>
<div><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3919" src="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bound-Angle-Pose-300x300.png" alt="A sketch of a woman in bound angle pose" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bound-Angle-Pose-300x300.png 300w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bound-Angle-Pose-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bound-Angle-Pose-150x150.png 150w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bound-Angle-Pose-768x768.png 768w, https://nanniesbynoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bound-Angle-Pose.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></div>
<p>From here, find yourselves a seated position on the ground. Let&nbsp;your feet find each other, and hold onto your ankles. If this is uncomfortable,&nbsp;try putting something under your knees. It&nbsp; could be a small towel or any kind&nbsp;of cushion you have handy. Notice which parts of your&nbsp; bodies are making contact&nbsp;with the floor. Ground yourselves through those parts, and feel the support of&nbsp;the floor as you breathe in and lift through the top of your head, neck and&nbsp;spine.</p>
<h1>Namaste</h1>
<p>As you wrap up, take a second to remind your little one how&nbsp;well they’ve done during this yoga practice! Take a deep breath, as you prepare&nbsp;for the rest of your day.&nbsp;</p>						</div>

							<p class="MsoNormal">It&#8217;s easy to use positive language when praising toddlers
for milestones or expressing love, but what about those moments when you need
to say &#8220;No!&#8221; or &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that!&#8221; in a constructive way?
Here are some tips to help you stay positive in the heat of the moment while
maintaining consistency.<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">If you’ve ever tried telling a toddler “No” you may know firsthand
it’s a toss up whether or not they’ll heed your advice. There’s a reason for
this. “No” is a more complex concept than many realize. Even though toddlers
use the word “no,” <a href="https://www.positivediscipline.com/articles/what-does-your-child-under-three-really-know-about-no#:~:text=Children%20under%20the%20age%20of,It%20is%20a%20developmental%20process.)">they
may not understand it the way you expect them to</a>. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">When you think about it, “no” and “don’t” aren’t concrete
directives. Adults and older children are able to take the word “no” as a
command and do the opposite, but toddlers are not wired that way yet. Intrinsic
to their nature, toddlers are little explorers constantly becoming more and
more independent. They are wired to “do” as opposed to “not do.” <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Remember that toddlers are
constantly learning and developing, so it&#8217;s important to be patient and understanding
as they navigate the world of language. Toddlers don’t process words as quickly
as adults do. Their budding language skills are forming, so <a href="https://challengingbehavior.org/docs/backpack/BackpackConnection_emotions_language.pdf">it
takes a few seconds or more for them to wrap their minds around what you just
said.</a> With that in mind, giving a young toddler a negative command like
“stop it” isn’t really setting them up for success. <o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Giving toddlers concrete directives can be a great way to
help them understand what you want from them. Here are a few more examples of how
you can give toddlers a solid direction to better communicate them:<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Instead of saying…<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Don&#8217;t play rough,&#8221; you can say &#8220;Use kind
words and gentle hands.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Stop running,&#8221; you can say &#8220;Walk slowly and
stay safe.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a mess,&#8221; you can say &#8220;Put your
toys away when you&#8217;re done playing with them.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">“Don’t touch that,” you can say “Keep your arms by your
sides.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">“No, don’t destroy the train set your sister just put
together,” you can say “Let’s work together to take care of each other’s toys.”<o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Remember to keep your language simple and clear, and to use
positive language whenever possible. By giving your child specific instructions
and positive reinforcement, you can help them make the right choice in a safe
and supportive environment.<o:p></o:p></p><p>























</p><p class="MsoNormal">By giving them a positive action to take, they are more
likely to follow your instruction. Additionally, toddlers respond well to
praise and positive reinforcement. When they do something you want them to do,
make sure to give them plenty of praise and encouragement. This will help them
feel good about themselves and encourage them to continue behaving in positive
ways. It&#8217;s also important to remember that toddlers are constantly learning and
growing, so try to be patient and understanding as they explore the world
around them.<o:p></o:p></p>						</div>
